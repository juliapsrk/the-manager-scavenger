// Module 1 Project - Game

// Game Requirements

// create original game, no clones
// must be built using Canvas, specifically with a 2d context
// must have an animation loop
// needs to be winnable/loosable (or at least complete it)
// needs to be deployed through Netlify
// no 3rd party libraries
// presentations are going to be on Saturday, 5th of March

// Game Idea

// title = The Manager Scavenger

// player = person stuck in a shitty corporate job
    // image: guy wearing suit on top, basketball shorts on the bottom

// enemy = various enemies, different levels of damage
    // 50 points: 'boss' or corporate logo type
    // 30 points: 'projects'
    // 15 points: 'zoom calls'
    // 5 points: 'emails'

// defense = 'f***s to give', different levels
    // player starts with initial count of 100
    // 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50 come flying in inbetween for 'top-ups'

// game-end
    // you loose when you hit 0
    // no max. limit

// Game-Over

// game-over message: "New Pay-check. You're gonna be stuck in this rat-race forever, looser."

// increase obstacle speed, increment every 30 seconds for example
// use power-ups as shield or throw them
// add 'power-down', not an obstacle, that makes you bigger for example to increase target

// how to implement it

// how to make class about main character, what to keep track of;
// their health, their collectibles (power-up or obstacle), 
// movement (up/down,left/right, diagonal), operate game with mouse 
// or keyboard

// what do I consider a collision, touch me or go across me?
// how will game start, click on start button?, or game just starts
